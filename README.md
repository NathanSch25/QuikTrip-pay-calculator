This programe calculates the anual, monthly, weekely pay of a QuikTrip employee while also taking into account Seniority, 
profit bonuses, anual bonuses, and CSA bonuses. the only bonus not acounted for is the dscritionary bonus and that is because
it is variable and not a guarenteed bonus like the others. 
I have changed all the non public information to a 1,2,3 or 4 so that I could publicly post this. When using official numbers
the outputed pay was within $1000 for anual pay witch is the adition or multiplication of all the other values gathered.
